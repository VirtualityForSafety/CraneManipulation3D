# CraneManipulation3D

CraneManipulation3D is a simple virtual training implementation which includes five stage of equipment operation. You can find the original description of the task in [Annotation vs. Virtual Tutor: Comparative Analysis on the Effectiveness of Visual Instructions in Immersive Virtual Reality](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336592427_Annotation_vs_Virtual_Tutor_Comparative_Analysis_on_the_Effectiveness_of_Visual_Instructions_in_Immersive_Virtual_Reality) appeared at [ISMAR 2019](https://www.ismar19.org/). This implementation is an open source version which does not include the 'virtual crane' and reimplemented with [Tasc-Unity](https://github.com/JinkiJung/Tasc-Unity).
