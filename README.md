# CraneManipulation3D

CraneManipulation3D is a simple virtual training implementation which includes five stage of equipment operation. You can find the original description of the task in the 'Annotation vs. Virtual Tutor: Comparative Analysis on the Effectiveness of Visual Instructions in Immersive Virtual Reality' which will be appeared at [ISMAR 2019](https://www.ismar19.org/). This implementation is an open source version which does not include the 'virtual crane' and reimplemented with [Tasc-Unity](https://github.com/JinkiJung/Tasc-Unity).
